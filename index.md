# About Me
I'm a technical writer based out of Denver, Colorado. In my career, I've regularly interfaced with Product, Engineering, QA, Training, and Customer Support/Operations organizations. It's always been my pleasure (and challenge!) to ensure that every deliverable I write is understandable and consumable to the targeted audience.
